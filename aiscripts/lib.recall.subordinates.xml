<!--
Whenever an L or XL ship attempts to recall its subordinates, exclude civilian fleet members to be recalled.
This should prevent S or M members from being unreasonably recalled by L or XL fleet leaders.
Does not consider XS members, since they are drones, and drones should follow their commanders' orders at all times.
-->
<!--
Note: as I revisit the code for vanilla (v4.0) Recall Subordinates, I noticed that it already filters out subordinates whose default order (exists) is not Escort.
This means civilian fleet members are already excluded. This patch file is likely prehistoric artifact for excluding civilian fleet members (then still using Defend assignment) from getting recalled
