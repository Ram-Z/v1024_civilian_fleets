<!-- 
Whenever a ship tries to obtain "first" orders...
1. Because it has just been freshly constructed (NOT OUR MAIN POINT)
2. Because it has just received a new assignment
Do:
1. Check if it is a ship-to-ship assignment (passively checked as a result of original code structure)
2. Check if it is being assigned to another ship running a recognized civilian command
3. If [2] returns true, syncs the civilian command from the commander to itself
4. If [2] returns true, also updates the wing name appropriately
